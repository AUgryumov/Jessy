This is a bot for vk.com.
You can test her [there](https://vk.cc/6ELeHl)

### TODO
I want to add some new commands. Also I want to document code. You can fork it and create your own bot.

### Technical details
This project, how You can see, written on Go (Golang). So, I run it on my Raspberry pi.
For database I use [AIML](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIML).
